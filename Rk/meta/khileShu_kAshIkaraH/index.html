  <h2 id="introductory">Introductory</h2>
<p>The Rgveda Samhitā has, according to the Sakala śäkhā, 1017 hymns. According to the Caraṇavyūha, the Rgveda Samhitā has come down in five recensions: Sākala, Başkala, Āśvalāyana, Sārkhāyana and Mândūkāyana. (Besides these five, many more Sakhas (21, 25 or 27) are said to have existed.) Of these, the Sākala recension is well known and has come down in a definite form. (2. It is to be noted that Kausitaki is different from Sānkhāyana. A Kausitaki Ghya Sūtra as different from the Sānkhāyana Gțhya has recently been published (Dr. T. R, Chintamani, Madras, 1944 ) and the publication of other Kauşitaki texts is also promised.)</p>
<p>The other recensions did not differ much from the Sākala recension except an omission or addition of certain hymns or verses within or without the Mandalas and also within or without the hymns, as well as certain changes in the order of hymns or verses. No definite conclusions seem to have been drawn as to the exact nature of each of these recensions for want of decisive data.</p>
<h2 id="the-khilas">The khilas</h2>
<p>The additional hymns or verses called Khilani have come down traditionally even though it has not been possible to attribute them to definite recensions and it is customary to publish them as a supplement to the Rgveda Samhita in the Sakala recension. Thus Prof. Max Müller has published at the end of his great edition of Rgveda Samhitā with the commentary of Sayanācārya, 32 Khilas with or without accents which he found in certain MSS. of Rgveda. (3. Second edition, Oxford 1890-2. ) Prof. Theodor Aufrecht in his edition of Rgveda Samhita printed in Roman characters has published 25 Khilas some of which are different from those in Max Müller&rsquo;s edition. (4. Second edition, Bonn 1877.) The Bombay edition of Rgveda Samhitā (Saka 1810-12) with Sāyaṇabhāşya edited by the two Mahāmabopādhyāyas Rajaramasastri Bodas and Sivaramasastri Gore gives a good number of Khilas including the Nivids, Praişas, Purorucas, Kuntāpas etc. under the title Parisistäni. The Nirnayasagar edition of Rgveda Samhita (Bombay 1891) also gave the Khilas. Prof. Peterson in his Catalogue of MSS. in the Alwar State Library has reproduced a few, though not all, Khilas with accents found in certain Samhitā and Pada MSS. of Rgveda deposited in that Library. Recently Pandit S. D. Satavalekar of Aundh (Dist. Satara) has published in his edition of Rgveda Samhita (Aundh, 1940) 36 Khilas, some of which are not found in the abovementioned editions ether fully or in part. Pandit Satavalekar, however, has not mentioned the MSS. material on which he has based his edition of Khilas, at least the additional portion of them. In all these editions the places where the particular Khilas are to be recited are also denoted, and in most cases they agree with each other. (1. He has kindly lent me two MSS. of Sankhāyana Samhita of Rgveda which he must have used. See p. 894. He has, however, obviously used some additional material. Pandit Anant Yajñeswar Dhupkar Sastri of Marcell Goa (Portuguese India ) who worked for the second edition of Aundh Rgveda, informs me by letter that for editing the Khilas he used a MS. of his own, about 200 years old. For two Khilas inserted in the Aundh odition by conjecture, see notes to Khilas II. 1 ; IV.9.)</p>
<p>By far the most important and extensive collection of Khilas is preserved in a MS. of Rgveda Sarhitā discovered in Kashmir by Prof. G. Bühler and described for the first time in his &ldquo;Detailed Report of a tour in search of Sanskrit MSS.&rdquo;, Bombay 1877, pp. 35-6. The MIS. was procured for the library of the Deccan College, Poona, which is now transferred to the Bhandarkar Oriental Rescarch Institute, Poona, where it is deposited at present. The MS. was transcribed by Dr. H. Wenzel and the transcript was examined by Max Müller, Macdonell and other scholars in Europe. Macdonell made use of this transcript in his cdition of Brhad-devata (Harvard Oriental Series Vol. 5 &amp; 6, 1904) and while describing in his introduction the Khila portions in the MS. he remarked that there seems reason to believe that a satisfactory edition of the text of these Khilas could be produced from the Kashmir MS.&rdquo; (p. xxiii). The credit of editing the Kashmir Khilas and bringing out their critical value goes to Dr. phil. J. Scheftelowitz who prepared and published in Roman characters a critical edition of the same at Bonn in 1906 under the title &ldquo;Apokryphon des Rgveda.&rdquo; Since the Kashmir MS. gives a comprehensive collection of authentic Khilas, I propose to present here all Khilas in the Kashmir MS. with a comparative study of those published in other editions and also of those available in MSS.</p>
<h2 id="the-kashmir-ms">The Kashmir MS.</h2>
<p>The MS. is written on birch bark and consists of 191 leaves each measuring 10.25&rdquo; by 9.5&rdquo;. The birch bark being very thin, cach leaf of the MS. is made up of two sheets pasted back to back so as to make it rather thick and serviceable for writing purposes. The leaves are written on both sides and are arranged in the form of a modern book. Thirty two lines on an average are written on each page and there are 40 letters in a line. Several leaves are much injured. Borders of the first and last few leaves have worn out. The MS. is written in Sārada characters and the handwriting is bold, legible and correct. (2. Cf. Catalogue of the Government Collections of Manuscripts, Deccan College, Poona 1916, MS. No. 1, Scheftelowitz, pp. 32-3,) The colophon of the MS. runs thus:- इति श्रीऋग्वेदे शाकलके शाखायां दशममण्डले ऋग्वेदः खिल-सहित-संहितारण्यसहितश् च संपूर्णस्, समाप्तं। सं ५१ भा शु ति १३ लिखितं । भट्ट-भीम-स्वामिनो रामि-स्वामिनः पुत्रः शबलस्वामिनः पौत्रस् सम्पाद्यतं समाप्तम्॥ शुभमस्तु॥. Thus the copyist of the MS. is the son of भट्टभीमस्वामिन रामिस्वामिन् and grandson of शबलस्वामिन् . According to A. B. Keith, these concluding words are written by a later hand and probably denote an owner of the MS. He also adds that the same hand has here and there made some corrections in the text. According to Bühler the MS. is 400 years old. The century in the date given in the colophon is lost, but Bühler adds that [Fara ] f 49 corresponds to A.D. 75. According to Keith 49 most probably corresponds to A.D. 1575. The only alternatives are A.D. 1475 and 1675, but he doubts whether the MS. is so old as the former or so modern as the latter of these dates.</p>
<p>In leaves 1-176 Řgveda Samhitā is written along with the Sarvānukramaņi of Kātyāyana. The Adhyāya system is followed in the enumeration of the Samhitā, the whole Rgveda being divided into 64 Adhyāyas. There is also the Mandala division, but the Aştaka division is totally absent. At the end of each Mandala there is a sentence indicating the conclusion of the last and the commencement of the next Mandala. There is no division of the Anuvākas nor that of the Suktas ; the Adhyāyas are divided into Vargas, but the number of verse is not shown. This method often makes it impossible to know where a hymn begins or ends. The end of a verse or half verse is denoted either by a perpendicular stroke or by the absence of Sandhi where in fact it is expected according to the Sandhi rules. Like the Rgveda Samhitā, the Sarvānukramaņī is also divided into Adhyāyas and the Anukramaņi portion belonging to each Adhyāya is given at the beginning of the same. The MS. belongs to the Sakala sākhā as is clearly stated in the concluding words of Mandala X and at the end of the whole MS.</p>

<li>JRAS 1907, p. 225.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-khila-portion">The Khila Portion</h3>
<p>The Khila portion is contained in folios 176 Bm 189B of the MS.2 All Khilas are divided into five Adhyāyas, each Adhyāya again being divided into Vargas. Scheftelowitz has shown this Varga number while I have dropped it. Yet there was no clue to know where a Khila began or ended. The Khilānukramanī helped in this respect. At the beginning of each Adhyāya there is the Khilanukramani portion belonging to it. It records the number of verses in a Khila, its author, metre and deity. Thus we are in a position to reproduce the Khilas at least as they stood in the time of the Khilānukramanī. The information of the Khilānukramaņi agrees with that in the Brahmanas, Řkprātiśākhya, Brhaddevatā, Rgvidhāna, Srautasūtras and Grhyasūtras. The MS. quotes at the end of each Khila the Pratīka of the next Rgvedic verse before which the particular Khila is to be recited. If a number of Khilas stand together, the Pratīka stands at the end of the last Khila.</p>
<p>(2. At the end of the Khilas there is some portion of the Aitareyāranyaka (folios 189B. 191). It is divided into three Adhyāyas, the first two of which form the third Aranyaka. The third Adhyâya giving Sanhitāraṇyam is reproduced by Scbeftelowitz in his edition.)</p>
<p>The copyist of this MS. did not write the Samhita or the Khilas by mere memory ; he probably copied from a text written in Sārada script, as is clear from the several writing mistakes. (1. For the orthographical peculiarities of this MS., see Scheftelowitz, pp. 47-8.)</p>
<h3 id="accent">Accent</h3>
<p>The text is accented throughout. The method of marking accents is peculiar. Generally in Vedic MSS. the Anudātta and Svarita are denoted by horizontal and vertical strokes respectively, while in this MS. only the Udātta and primary Syarita are marked. The Udätta is marked by a small vertical stroke. This kind of marking Udätta is also found in the Maitrāyani Samhitā (Cf. Schröder, Preface p. xXx). The primary Svarita is denoted by the sign  ᳠. This sign occurs twice in the Khila portion (1. 11. 4 ; 12. 7).</p>
<p>In Kāțhaka Samhitā a strong curve above the line comes as a sign of the primary Svarita, while in Maitrāyaṇi Samhitā the curve lies below the line (Cf. Schröder, ibid.). If the next syllable is accented, the primary Svarita is denoted by ३ (Trikampa) even though the preceding syllable is short. This &lsquo;३&rsquo; which stands after the Svarita syllable has either a horizontal stroke below the line or a perpendicular stroke above the line. Scheftclowitz has retained this method of accentuation in his edition ; the same has been followed here too, In the case of certain supplementary hymns and verses also he has mostly marked the Udātta. I have given all of them without accents. In certain editions and MSS. these later Khilas are found accented, but the accents are not unanimous.+++(5)+++ It is to be noted that Max Müller has, in his edition, printed all such Khilas without accents.</p>
<h2 id="additional-material">Additional Material</h2>
<p>For the constitution of the text of thc Khilas, I have also used two MSS. of Sankhāyana sākha of Rgveda kindly lent to me by Pandit S. D. Satavalekar of Aundh. They come from Junagadh and Navanagar in Kathiawar. The Junagadh MS. was written in Samwat 1754-5 and the accents were marked in red ink in Samwat 1755-8. The colophon at the end of Aştaka VIII runs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>संवत् १७५४ वर्षे भाद्रपद शुदि ५ बुधे श्रीजीर्ण-दुर्गनिवासीय आभ्यन्तर-नागर-ज्ञातीय पंडा श्री गोविंदसुत् पंडा श्री ॥ भवानीदास सुत रघुनाथेन लिखितं ॥ सं. १७५८ वर्षे कार्तिक शुदि २ बुधे पं । श्री ॥ भवानीदाससुत रघुनाथेन स्व० ॥</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Navanagar MS. was written in Samwat 1894–5 and the accents were marked in red in Samvat 1898. The colophon at the end of Aştaka VIII runs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>संवत् १८९४ ना मार्गशिर्ष शुदि ११ प्रारंभः सं। १८९५ ना कार्तिक शुक्ल १२ भोमे अद्य श्रीनवा-नगर-वास्तव्य आभ्यंतर-वृद्ध-नागर-ज्ञातीय आचार्य श्री ५ भवांनसुत् गोविंदजियेन पंड्या श्री ५ जगजीवनसुत् रणछोडजीसुत् मोतिरांमने कृष्णार्पण लिखिदत्वा&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text in both the MSS. is divided into 64 Adhyāyas. There is no Aştaka division, while the beginning and the end of a Mandala are mentioned. On comparison, I find that both these MSS. are exactly identical with each other except a few scribal errors. So I have preferred to refer only to the Junagadh MS. by the designation जुना, on account of its older age and its peculiarity of marking accents.</p>
<p>The accents in the Navanagar MS. are marked in the usual manner, i.e. the Anudātta by a horizontal stroke below the letter and the Syarita by a perpendicular stroke above the letter. In the Junagadh MS., however, the Svarita is marked by a horizontal line through the body of the letter and the Anudātta is marked as usual. (1. It may, by the way, be noted that both these MSS, ma &lsquo;१&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;३&rsquo; in three places (Val. I. 3; VI. 7; VII, 1) in the Vālakhilya hymns.) This method is exactly the same as that in part of one of the Alwar MSS. of Rgveda Samhitā which are described in the Catalogue as belonging to the Šānkhāyana sākhā (See &lsquo;A Second Report of operations in search of Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Circle&rsquo;, 1883–84 by Peter Peterson; Extra No. JBBRAS 1884). There is no direct proof in the MSS. themselves showing their Sankhāyana character, just as there is none also in the Alwar MSS. One does not know what was the position of the Khilas found in these MSS. in the Sankhāyana sākhā. It is to be noted that most of the Khilas are included within Varga numbers in both the Alwar and Junagadh MSS.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of the Sankhāyana redaction as denoted in the commentary on Caraṇavyūha is found in these MSS., namely that the 10th Valakhilya hymn (VIII. 58) is absent and two of its three verses are inserted after ķV. X. 88. 18 as a Khila. Whether this peculiarity exists in the Alwar MSS., is not known from Peterson&rsquo;s description. An exhaustive comparison of the Junagadh MS. with the Alwar MSS. could not be made, since the latter were not available on loan. Arrangements to obtain the required information could not also prove successful. I have, therefore, to rely on Peterson&rsquo;s description of the MSS. and the text of some of the Khilas given by him.</p>
<p>A comparison of the Junagadh and Alwar MSS. reveals certain differences in the Khila portion :</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) The Khila सूक्तान्ते तृणान्य् अग्नाव् अरण्ये comes in Alwar MS. after RV. V. 49; in the Junagadh MS. it comes after RV. VI. 48.</li>
<li>(2) The Alwar MS. does not contain Srīsūkta (Khila II. 6) which is present in the Junagadh MS.</li>
<li>(3) The Sivasamkalpasūkta (Yenedam IV. 11) which seems to be absent in the Alwar MS., is found in the Junagadh MS.</li>
<li>(4) Khilas III 19; 20; IV. 12 are found in the Junagadh MS.; they do not exist in the Alwar MS.</li>
<li>(5) In three Khilas the number of verses in both the MSS. is different : (
<ul>
<li>(a) Khila II. 12 has two verses in the Alwar MS., 3 in the Junagadh MS.</li>
<li>(b) In Khila II. 13 the Junagadh MS. gives 3 additional verses after the first 3 verses.</li>
<li>(c) In Khila IV. 2 (Rātrīsākta) the Junagadh MS. reveals two more verses than the Alwar MS., one of which is found in the Nirnayasagar edition of Rgveda and the other is quite a new one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Barring these differences, the Junagadh and Alwar MSS. agree with each other. One is inclined to gather from these differences in Saikhāyana MSS., that the Khilas were probably not enumerated as a part of the Samhită in spite of their enumeration within the Varga number. The question, however, remains, which Khilas were recognised as Khilas in the Sāňkhāyana sākhā. Peterson has described the Alwar MSS. in comparison to Aufrecht&rsquo;s edition of Khilas, and one is not sure about the position of the Alwar MSS. with regard to the Khilas not found in Aufrecht. The end of the Khila portion is exactly the same in both MSS. After giving the Khila विदा मघवन् विदा, both the MSS. have अग्निदेवेद्धः विदा मघवन्विदों. The text of the Khilas in the Junagadh MS. is mostly identical with that in the Alwar MSS. I have fully recorded the variants in the Junagadh MS. I have also recorded the additional verses found in it (See Khilas II. 13; IV. 2). In the Kashmir MS. the beginning portion in Khila III. 20 was broken to the extent of four syllables. This Khila has fortunately been found in the Junagadh MS. I, therefore, filled in the blank on its authority by inserting यच्च कृतं found in it and have shown it in brackets. Scheftelowitz has conjectured the lost text as that. In two Khilas, III. 19; IV. 12 the Junagadh MS. presented a better text than the Kashmir MS. to a great extent. I have, therefore, adopted it in preference to the Kashmir text.</p>
<p>Scheftelowitz has, in his edition, also used two MSS. (No. 30 and 155 Müncher Sanskrit MSS. = Haug&rsquo;s Verzeichnis d. orient. Handschr. No. 34 &amp; 318) which he designates as M, and M2 respectively. Both these contain portions of the fifth Adhyāya. MS. No. 30 contains Nivids, Praişas, Purorucas and Kuntāpādhyāya. No. 155 contains only thc Nivids and Praişas. Scheftelowitz has recorded all readings from these MSS. Since, however, most of these readings were found identical with those from other sources, I have not referred to them. In very rare cases where the MSS. gave peculiar readings, I have recorded them without mentioning the source.</p>
<p>Khila IV. 11 is the Sivasamkalpopanişad coming after RV. X. 166. In the Kashmir MS. it consists of 13 verses. The same hymn has 28 verses in a MS. of Rgveda Samhitā, No. Add 5351 in the British Museum, London. All the 13 verses in the Kashmir Khila are covered by the Khila in the British Museum MS., though in a different order. The Khila with the same 28 verses with identical text is also found in another MS., No. 2131 in the India Office Library, London. Scheftelowitz has publislied the text of the 28-versed Khila along with notes and German translation. (1. ZDMG 1921, Band 75, pp. 201-12.) I have reproduced it in the notes to the shorter Khila in the Kashmir MS. (2. In verse 7a the Kashmir MS. has lost one letter; the British Museum Ms. supplied it and made up the word गुह्यं.) This larger version of Sivasamkalpopanişad is also found in the Junagadh MS. The Aundh edition also gives the same Khila of 26 verses, some of which are different from those in the British Museum MS. The order of verses in the Aundh edition as well as the variants in the same are also recorded in the notes to the same.</p>
